First Serve Analysis for Federer, Nadal and Djokovic

This project analyzed the importance of first serve percentage for the three best players of all time: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. 

With t-test and logistic regression, the project intends to quantify how first serve percentage will increase the odds of winning for each of these three players.  

The project also includes a court surface analysis:  by filtering for each major court surface, a logistic regression was ran for each player on each surface to try to explain the success of these players on grass, clay or hard court.
